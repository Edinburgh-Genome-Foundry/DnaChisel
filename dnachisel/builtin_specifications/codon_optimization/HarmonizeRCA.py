class HarmonizeRCA(BaseCodonOptimizationClass):
    """Codon-Harmonize a native sequence for a new host (Claassens method).

    This specification will optimize a Sequence 1 from Host 1 into a Sequence
    2 for target Host 2.

    In simple, rare Host 1 codons will be replaced by rare Host 2 codons, and
    high-frequency Host 1 codons will get replaced by codons that are
    high-frequency in Host 2.

    In more specific, each codon along Sequence 1 gets replaced by the codon
    whose Relative Codon Adaptiveness (RCA) in Host 2 is the closest from the
    RCA of the original codon in Host 1. A codon's RCA in a given organism is
    defined by f/fmax where f is the codon's frequency in the organism and fmax
    is the highest frequency of all synonymous codons.

    The minimized quantity is sum_i abs(RCA(c_i, H1) - RCA(c'_i, H2))
    where c_i, c'_i represent the i-th codon before and after optimization

    This method is taken from Claassens 2017, where they simplify a previous
    algorithm (Angov 2008), which was much more complicated as it involved
    predicting "ribosome pausing" sites in the sequence.

    Warning: always use with an EnforceTranslation constraint.


    Parameters
    ----------
    species
      Name or TaxID of the species for which to optimize the sequence. A custom
      codon_usage_table can be provided instead (or in addition, for species
      names whose codon usage table cannot be imported).

    codon_usage_table
      Optional - can be provided instead of ``species``. A dict of the form
      ``{'*': {"TGA": 0.112, "TAA": 0.68}, 'K': ...}`` giving the codon
      frequency table (relative usage of each codon; frequencies add up to 1,
      separately for each amino acid).

    original_species
      Name or TaxID of the species the original sequence was taken from. This
      information will be used to spot codons which are supposed to be rare
      or common. A codon_usage_table can be provided instead (or in addition,
      for species names whose codon usage table cannot be imported).

    original_codon_usage_table
      A dict of the form ``{'*': {"TGA": 0.112, "TAA": 0.68}, 'K': ...}``
      giving the codon frequency table (relative usage of each codon;
      frequencies add up to 1, separately for each amino acid).

    location
      Location on which the specification applies

    boost
      Score multiplicator (=weight) for when the specification is used as an
      optimization objective alongside competing objectives.
