    Parameters
    ----------

    sequence_length
      You guessed it.

    probas
      Either None for a fully random initial sequence, or a dict of the form
      {"A": 0.5, "T": 0.2, ...} to tune initial nucleotide representation

    constraints
      List of all DnaChisel specifications that will be applied as constraints.

    seed
      Optional seed for the random number generator, for reproducibility.

    max_random_iters
      Maximum number of random tries per location solving for the solver.

    logger
      Either 'bar' or None (no logger) or any proglog logger.
