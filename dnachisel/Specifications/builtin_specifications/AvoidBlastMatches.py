    WARNING: try using AvoidMatches instead, it is much better!!

    Uses NCBI Blast+. Only local BLAST is supported/tested as for now

    Parameters
    ----------

    blast_db
      Path to a local BLAST database. These databases can be obtained with
      NCBI's `makeblastdb`. Omit the extension, e.g. `ecoli_db/ecoli_db`.

    word_size
      Word size used by the BLAST algorithm

    perc_identity
      Minimal percentage of identity for BLAST matches. 100 means that only
      perfect matches are considered.

    num_alignments
      Number alignments

    num_threads
      Number of threads/CPU cores to use for the BLAST algorithm.

    min_align_length
      Minimal length that an alignment should have to be considered.
