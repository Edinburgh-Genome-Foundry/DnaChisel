    Shorthand for annotations: "primer".

    Parameters
    ----------

    location
      The exact location where the primer will anneal, i.e. the subsequence
      under this location will be the sequence

    tmin, tmax
      Minimum and maximum acceptable melting temperatures in Celcius, for
      instance 55 and 70. When the used as an optimization objective the
      "target" will be (tmin + tmax)/2.
    max_homology_length
      Maximal length of any homology between the subsequence at that location
      and anywhere else in the whole sequence.

    avoid_heterodim_with
      List of ATGC strings representing external (primer) sequences with which
      the optimised location should have no annealing.

    max_heterodim_tm
      Max melting temperature of the heterodimerization between this subsegment
      and the other sequences in "avoid_heterodim_with"

    avoided_repeats
      Properties of the repeated patterns avoided. List of pairs (K, N)
      meaning "avoid K-mers repeated N times in a row".
