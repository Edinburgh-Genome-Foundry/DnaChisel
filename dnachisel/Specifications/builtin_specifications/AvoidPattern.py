    Parameters
    ----------

    pattern
      A SequencePattern or DnaNotationPattern

    location
      Location of the DNA segment on which to enforce the pattern e.g.
      ``Location(10, 45, 1)``. For patterns which are not palyndromic,
      the strand matters! use +1 for eliminating the pattern on the +1 strand
      only, -1 for eliminating the pattern on the -1 strand, and 0 for
      eliminating the pattern on both strands.

    strand
      Alternative way to set the strand, meant to be used in two cases only:
      (1) in a Genbank annotation by setting ``strand=both`` to indicate that
      the pattern should be avoided on both strands (otherwise, only the
      feature's strand will be considered).
      (2) if you want to create a specification without preset location, but
      with a set strand: ``AvoidPattern('BsmBI_site', strand=1)``
