class EnforceChanges(Specification):
    """Specify that some locations of the sequence should be changed/different.

    The input for this specification is a bit complex as it is different for
    objectives and constraints:

    - **For constraints**, use EnforceChanges() to force all nucleotides to
      be different from the reference (by default, the reference is the
      starting sequence). Use EnforceChanges(minimum=3) to enforce at least
      3 nucleotide changes, or EnforceChanges(minumum_percent=70) to enforce
      at least 70% change. Note that having a minimum makes computations much
      slower.
    - **For objectives**, use EnforceChanges() to maximize the number of
      nucleotide changes, or use EnforceChanges(amount=10) to aim at a
      10-nucleotides change (no more, no less), or use
      EnforceChanges(minumum_amount=70) to aim at 70% change, no more no less.

    As a genbank annotation:

    - ``@change``, ``@change(minimum=40%)``, ``@change(minimum=3)`` will
      enforce respectivel 100% different nucleotides, 40%+ different, and 3+
      nucleotides different.
    - ``~change``, ``~change(40%)``, ``~change(3)`` to aim at, respectively,
      as close as possible to 100% change, 40% changes, or a target of 3
      nucleotides changes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    location
      Location object indicating the position of the segment that must be
      different from the original sequence. Alternatively,
      indices can be provided. If neither is provided, the assumed location
      is the whole sequence.

    amount
       Number of differences desired in the final sequence when the spec. is
       used as an objective. An amount_percent can be provided instead.

    amount_percent
      Same as ``amount``, except the desired number of differences is decided
      at initialization, as a percentage of the number of nucleotides in the
      region covered.

    minimum
      Minimal number of differences enforced in the final sequence when the
      spec. is used as an constraint. A minimum_percent can be provided
      instead.

    minimum_percent
      Same as ``minimum``, except the desired number of differences is decided
      at initialization, as a percentage of the number of nucleotides in the
      region covered.

    indices
      List of indices that must be different from the original sequence.

    reference
      At the moment, this is rather an internal variable. Do not use unless
      you're not afraid of side effects.
