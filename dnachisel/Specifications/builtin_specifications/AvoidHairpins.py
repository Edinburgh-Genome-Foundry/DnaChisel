    A hairpin is defined by a sequence segment which has a reverse complement

    ----------
    stem_size
      Size of the stem of a hairpin, i.e. the length of the sequence which
      should have a reverse complement nearby to be considered a hairpin.

    hairpin_window
      The window in which the stem's reverse complement should be searched for.

      Multiplicative factor, importance of this objective in a multi-objective
