    """Avoid sub-sequence of length k with homologies elsewhere.

    NOTE: For sequences with subsequences appearing more than 2 times, the
    specification may not work as a problem constraint, but will work as a
    problem optimization objective.

    You can define a location L and an reference L* (by default they
    are both the full sequence)

    >>>          [=== L ===]
    >>>
    >>>       [=========== L* ==========]
    >>>
    >>> --------- Sequence --------------------------

    This Specification class specifies that "No sub-sequence in L of length
    above k has more than 1 occurence in L*".

    Some specific cases

    - L = L* = Sequence. In this case the full sequence will have only unique
      kmers above a certain size (no self-homology).
    - L < L*, L* = Sequence. The segment L will have no self-homology and no
      homology to the rest of the sequence above a certain size. But there
      can be self-homologies elsewhere in the sequence.
    - L = L*. segment L will have no self-homology.

    Parameters
    ----------
    k
      Minimal length of sequences to be considered repeats
    
    reference
      The default None indicates that the specification's location should have
      no homologies anywhere in the whole sequence. If reference="here", then
      the specification's location should have no homology inside that same
      location. Reference can also be any location of the sequence that the
      specification's location should have no homologies with.

    location
      Segment of the sequence in which to look for repeats. If None, repeats
      are searched in the full sequence.

    include_reverse_complement
      If True, the sequence repeats are also searched for in the reverse
      complement of the sequence (or sub sequence if `location` is not None).

    Examples
    --------

    >>> from dnachisel import *
    >>> sequence = random_dna_sequence(50000)
    >>> constraint= UniquifyAllKmers(10, include_reverse_complement=True)
    >>> problem = DnaOptimizationProblem(sequence, constraints= [contraint])
    >>> print (problem.constraints_summary())
