        filepath
          Path to a target genbank file where the record will be written. If

        features_type
          Genbank standard type to give to all extra genbank annotation created
          by this method (to indicate constraints, objectives, edits, etc.)


        with_original_features
          If True, the features from the original record provided at problem
          creation will be included in the record (if a simple sequence, and
          not a record, was originally provided, then there is no such
          features)


        with_original_spec_features

          creation that defines a DNAChisel Specification be stripped off the
          record returned by this method (to make space for the annotations)
          created by this method

        with_constraints
          If True, annotations representing the constraints will be added to
          the record


        with_objectives
          If True, annotations representing the objectives will be added to the
          record


        with_sequence_edits
          If True, annotations representing each nucleotide change will be
          added to the record.


        colors_dict
          A dict indicating the feature color for constraints and objectives.
          The default is {"constraint": "#355c87", "objective": "#f9cd60"}.



        use_short_labels
          If True, the annotations representing constraints and objectives will
          use shorter labels to indicate the type of specification.

        -----

        If the original problem was created from a Genbank, it is a good idea
        to set with_original_spec_features=True and with_constraints=False,
