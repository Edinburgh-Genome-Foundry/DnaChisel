    """Problem specifications: sequence, constraints, optimization objectives.

    The original constraints, objectives, and original sequence of the problem
    are stored in the DNA problem. This class also has methods to display
    reports on the constraints and objectives, as well as solving the
    constraints and objectives.

    Examples
    --------

    >>> from dnachisel import *
    >>> problem = DnaOptimizationProblem(
    >>>     sequence = "ATGCGTGTGTGC...",
    >>>     constraints = [constraint1, constraint2, ...],
    >>>     objectives = [objective1, objective2, ...]
    >>> )
    >>> problem.resolve_constraints()
    >>> problem.optimize()
    >>> print(problem.constraints_text_summary())
    >>> print(problem.objectives_text_summary())


    Parameters
    ----------

    sequence
      A string of ATGC characters (they must be upper case!), e.g. "ATTGTGTA"

    constraints
      A list of objects of type ``Specification``.

    objectives
      A list of objects of type ``Specification`` specifying what must be
      optimized in the problem. Note that each objective has a float ``boost``
      parameter. The larger the boost, the more the objective is taken into
      account during the optimization.

    logger
      Either None for no logger, 'bar' for a tqdm progress bar logger, or
      any ProgLog progress bar logger.

    mutations_space
      A MutationSpace indicating the possible mutations. In most case the
      mutation space will be left to None and computed at problem
      initialization (which can be slightly compute-intensive), however some
      core DNA Chisel methods will create optimization problems with a provided
      mutation_space to save computing time.

    Attributes
    ----------

    randomization_threshold
      The algorithm will use an exhaustive search when the size of the mutation
      space (=the number of possible variants) is above this threshold, and
      a (guided) random search when it is above.

    max_random_iters
      When using a random search, stop after this many iterations

    mutations_per_iteration
      When using a random search, produce this many sequence mutations each
      iteration.

    optimization_stagnation_tolerance
      When using a random search, stop if the score hasn't improved in
      the last "this many" iterations

    local_extensions
      Try local resolution several times if it fails, increasing the mutable
      zone by [N1, N2...] nucleotides on each side, until resolution works.
      (by default, an extension of 0bp is tried, then 5bp.

    Notes
    -----

    The dictionnary ``self.possible_mutations`` is of the form
    ``{location1 : list1, location2: list2...}``
    where ``location`` is either a single index (e.g. 10) indicating the
    position of a nucleotide to be muted, or a couple ``(start, end)``
    indicating a whole segment whose sub-sequence should be replaced.
    The ``list`` s are lists of possible sequences to replace each location,
    e.g. for the mutation of a whole codon ``(3,6): ["ATT", "ACT", "AGT"]``.
