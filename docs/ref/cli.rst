Command Line Interface
----------------------

Installing the DNA Chisel python library automatically installs the
``dnachisel`` command line interace (CLI) accessible from the machine's terminal.

This interface enables to get a problem as an annotated genbank and output
the optimized sequence either as a single genbank or with a multi-file
optimization report.

Type ``dnachisel -h`` to display the documentation below, and see the
``examples/cli`` directory for files to test the command line interface on.
