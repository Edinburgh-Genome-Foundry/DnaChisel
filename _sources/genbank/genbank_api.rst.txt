Genbank API
===========

This section documents the Genbank API for all builtin specifications of
DNA chisel. See also the :ref:`genbank-usage-notes` section for tips.

.. caution:: Use either "=" or ":" in sequence annotation parameters

    For historical reasons, DNA Chisel allows to write keyword parameters
    with either ``:`` or ``=`` in genbank annotations, for instance both
    ``@no(ATG, strand:both)`` and ``@no(ATG, strand=both)`` are valid.

    While we find ``=`` more readable, we have also seen that some tools are
    confused by the presence of an ``=`` sign in a Genbank label, so using
    ``:`` may be safer.

Pattern removal
---------------

.. caution:: The annotation's direction matters!

    Since v3.0, the orientation of the annotation of pattern-based
    specifications such as ``no()`` or ``insert()`` indicates where to look for
    the pattern. Annotations in the +1 sense indicate that the
    pattern should only be looked for in the +1 (5'3') strand. Patterns in the -1
    strand are only looked at in the -1 (3'5') sense.

.. caution:: Use ``strand=both`` in Genbank files to target both strands.

    Standard Genbank does not allow you to create strands without direction
    (unlike the Biopython Record format, or the Snapgene format. So keep in
    mind that by default, only the feature's strand is considered. In ``@no()``
    and ``@insert()``, you can use ``strand=both`` to indicate that the pattern
    should be avoided in both strands, for instance ``@no(BsaI_site, strand=both)``.

To remove a pattern in a given region, use the ``@no()`` label
(alias for ``@AvoidPattern()``). For instance to remove any GC pattern:

.. raw:: html

    <img class='annotation-example'
    src='../_static/images/genbank_annotations/avoid_pattern_cg.png'></img>

This method also supports IUPAC nucleotide mutation for degenerate sequences
(NKY etc.) For instance to remove any ATC and ATT (which could be written
together as ATH):

.. raw:: html

    <img class='annotation-example'
    src='../_static/images/genbank_annotations/avoid_pattern_noisoleucine.png'></img>

It is also possible to provide an enzyme restriction site by suffixing the
enzyme name with ``_site``:

.. raw:: html

    <img class='annotation-example'
    src='../_static/images/genbank_annotations/avoid_pattern_enzyme.png'></img>

Other pattern shorthands can be used for instance to find sequence repeats
(here we look for dimers repeated four times in a row):

.. raw:: html

    <img class='annotation-example'
    src='../_static/images/genbank_annotations/avoid_pattern_kmer.png'></img>

When no pattern shorthand cuts it, use a regular expression! The annotation
below forbids any TAA sequence following an ATG sequence.


.. raw:: html

    <img class='annotation-example'
    src='../_static/images/genbank_annotations/avoid_pattern_regex.png'></img>

Finally, note that you can also use ``no()`` as an objective by prefixing it
with a tilde ``~no()``, at which case the pattern may not be completely
eliminated, but its number of occurences will be minimized by the algorithm:

.. raw:: html

    <img class='annotation-example'
    src='../_static/images/genbank_annotations/avoid_pattern_cg_obj.png'></img>

Sequence protection
-------------------

To prevent sections of the sequence to be modified, use ``@keep`` (alias for
``@AvoidChanges``):

.. raw:: html

    <img class='annotation-example'
    src='../_static/images/genbank_annotations/keep.png'></img>

You can also use ``keep`` as an optimization objective, at which case sequence
modifications will not be strictly forbidden, but they will be minimized:

.. raw:: html

    <img class='annotation-example'
    src='../_static/images/genbank_annotations/keep_obj.png'></img>

Forcing changes
---------------

In DNA Chisel, the opposite of specification ``AvoidChanges`` is
``EnforceChanges`` (shorthand notation ``change``). For instance, if you want
the solver to change a region as much as possible (for instance, to obfuscate a
sequence), use a ``~change`` annotation:

.. raw:: html

    <img class='annotation-example'
    src='../_static/images/genbank_annotations/change_objective.png'></img>

You can also ask for a certain amount of change, with for instance
``~change(40%)`` which will aim at changing 40% (no more, no less) of the
nucleotides under the annotation. You can also use the specification as a
constraint, for instance ``@change`` (the sequence will be totally changed) or
``@change(minimum=50%)`` which will ensures that the final sequence will be 50%
different from the original.

Pattern insertion
-----------------

You can control how many times a pattern should appear in a sequence region
with the ``@insert()`` specification (short form of ``@EnforcePatternOccurence``):

.. raw:: html

    <img class='annotation-example'
    src='../_static/images/genbank_annotations/insert.png'></img>

By default ``@insert()`` ensures that exactly one occurence of the pattern is
present in the given region, but it can also be used to create more occurences:

.. raw:: html

    <img class='annotation-example'
    src='../_static/images/genbank_annotations/insert_several.png'></img>

This specification can be used both to create new patterns in a region that
contains too few, or to decrease the pattern occurences i a region that contains
too many. Note that with the current algorithm, new occurences of the pattern
will be be preferentially placed towards the center of the selected region.

You can also enforce a sequence (or degenerate sequence) at an exact location
with ``@sequence`` (short for ``@EnforceSequence``):

.. raw:: html

    <img class='annotation-example'
    src='../_static/images/genbank_annotations/enforce_sequence.png'></img>

To enforce several same-length but quite different sequences, use
``@choice`` (short for ``@EnforceChoice``):

.. raw:: html

    <img class='annotation-example'
    src='../_static/images/genbank_annotations/choice.png'></img>

Indicating coding sequences
---------------------------

To indicate that a region is a CDS and the protein sequence should be conserved
(i.e. only synonymous codon mutations are allowed), use @cds (short for
@EnforceTranslation) on a region whose span is a multiple of 3:

.. raw:: html

    <img class='annotation-example'
    src='../_static/images/genbank_annotations/cds.png'></img>

.. caution:: Non-ATG start codons

    If the coding region has a start codon in an organisms using non-ATG
    start codons (for instance, E. coli sometimes use GTG), make sure to define
    a policy for the start codon, for instance ``start_codon=keep`` to keep the
    sequence of the original start codon, or ``start_codon=ATG`` to use ATG as
    a start codon. See the documentation of EnforceTranslation for more details
    and options.

Codon Optimization
-------------------

.. caution:: Always use with @cds

   If the CodonOptimize specification is used without a @cds constraint covering
   the same region, then the protein sequence is not guaranteed!

To codon-optimize a gene you can use the ``~CodonOptimize()`` specification but
it is faster and clearer to refer directly to one of the different methods available.

To replace each codon by its most common synonym (which is equivalent to maximizing
the CAI index):

.. raw:: html

    <img class='annotation-example'
    src='../_static/images/genbank_annotations/use_best_codon.png'></img>

To optimize the gene sequence so that the final codon representation matches
the codons frequencies of the target organism, use ``~match_codon_usage``:

.. raw:: html

    <img class='annotation-example'
    src='../_static/images/genbank_annotations/match_codon_usage.png'></img>

To harmonize codons so that a rare codon in the original host will be replaced
by a rare codon in the target host (and common codons are replaced by common
codons), use ``~harmonize_rca``:

.. raw:: html

    <img class='annotation-example'
    src='../_static/images/genbank_annotations/harmonize_rca.png'></img>

In the example above (``~harmonize_rca(e_coli -> h_sapiens)``), the original host is
``e_coli`` and the target host is  ``h_sapiens``, separated by an arrow (``->``).
See ``HarmonizeRCA`` for more details.
As you noticed we used species names in these examples. See
`the Codon Usage Tables package webpage <https://github.com/Edinburgh-Genome-Foundry/codon-usage-tables/tree/master/codon_usage_data/tables>`_
for species that can be referred to by name. This includes ``b_subtilis``,
``c_elegans``, ``d_melanogaster``, ``e_coli``, ``g_gallus``, ``h_sapiens``,
``m_musculus``, ``s_cerevisiae``. You can also use a TaxID to refer to a species,
e.g. ``species=1423`` at which case the codon frequencies will be downloaded from
the `Kazusa codon usage database <https://www.kazusa.or.jp/codon/>`_ (assuming it
isn't down!)


GC content
----------

Use ``@gc`` to ensure that a given region's GC content is between a
certain range

.. raw:: html

    <img class='annotation-example'
    src='../_static/images/genbank_annotations/gc_range.png'></img>

For large regions, you can use a windowed evaluation, e.g. with the parameter
``window=100`` to ensure that the GC content will remain in the desired range
over every 100bp subsegments of the sequence.

The specification can also be used as an optimization objective, at which case
it is preferable to provide a target rather than a range:

.. raw:: html

    <img class='annotation-example'
    src='../_static/images/genbank_annotations/gc_target.png'></img>

Removing homologies
-------------------

To ensure that a sequence region has no homologies anywhere else in the sequence
you can use ``all_unique_kmers``:

.. raw:: html

    <img class='annotation-example'
    src='../_static/images/genbank_annotations/all_unique_kmers.png'></img>

The annotation above ensures that each 20-mer in the annotated segment does not
appear anywhere else in the sequence or in its reverse-complement.

To ensure that a sequence region has no homologies within itself, use the "here"
parameter:

.. raw:: html

    <img class='annotation-example'
    src='../_static/images/genbank_annotations/all_unique_kmers_here.png'></img>

You can also avoid matches with a given organism you can also use ``avoid_matches``
.. raw:: html

    <img class='annotation-example'
    src='../_static/images/genbank_annotations/avoid_matches.png'></img>

.. caution:: Only works if supported by the server

   This specification, originally meant to be used via scripts, will only work
   if the server associates the organism name to a Bowtie index path.

Melting temperature
--------------------

The annotation ``tm`` can be used to ensure that a given subsequence has the
desired melting temperature. It can be used either as a constraint or as an
optimization objective:

.. raw:: html

    <img class='annotation-example'
    src='../_static/images/genbank_annotations/enforce_melting.png'></img>

.. raw:: html

    <img class='annotation-example'
    src='../_static/images/genbank_annotations/enforce_melting_obj.png'></img>

As a suggestion, you can use this specification with ``all_unique_kmers`` to
ensure that the resulting region is primer-friendly:

.. raw:: html

    <img class='annotation-example'
    src='../_static/images/genbank_annotations/enforce_melting_and_kmers.png'></img>
