"""We will build a collection of 20 non-interannealing primers.

DNA Chisel is not originally meant for creating collections of sequences
(frameworks such as D-tailor were written with this purpose in mind), but
it is still possible to create collections of inter-compatible sequences.

Here we create 20 short sequences one after the other, while making sure
that each new primer is "compatible" with the other ones made so far.
Compatibility in this example means low heterodimerization (=the primers
could be used together without undesired annealing between them).
